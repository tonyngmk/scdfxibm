# Rescuers

### a. Summary, Situational Analysis and Key Issues
Key issues we are targeting would be to aid in the CFRâ€™s sense-making at the onset of incidents and how we can better mobilise them in emergency situations. 

### b. Strategy and Recommendations
We would like to target the problem from two perspectives - within and outside of the house.

We propose a thermal imaging system to be installed in the homes where vulnerable people reside in. The thermal imaging system leverages on the concept of axis to identify instances of a fall. Subsequently, we will make use of a smart voice assistant in the same house to call for a response. If no response is received, the incident will be flagged and SCDF will be alerted.

A smart IoT lock is installed outside of these homes which solves the problem of elderly not having anyone in the house with them when an incident occurs. Continuing from above, after CFRs are alerted, those who want to help will receive a token to unlock these locks and enter the homes. 

### c. Implementation and Plan of Action
One of the main challenges our plan faces would be the vast amount of technologies that we are putting in and outside of the households. However, we believe that such technologies could be made simpler to reduce the costs. Also, R&D costs are not high since these technologies have already been available long ago - what we need to work on is the combination and how these technologies can complement each other to solve a problem.

### d. Conclusion

Overall speaking, the pros of our ideas outweighs the potential concerns that may arise and it is indeed a solution that is very scalable in the long run. By leveraging thermal imaging and the voice assistant, it will help both SCDF and CFRs understand what happened and make better sense out of the incident. By making use of a smart IoT lock, it helps with the safety issues that may arise.
